            <p class="text">To determine the business requirements on existing products, we have started to work on gathering information about the business requirements as well as user requirements on our existing product to know about how the user is interacting with our existing product and what are the problems they are facing while they are using.</p>

        
<p class="text">First we noted down the business constraints on existing products : 

The functionality of the existing thermostat is limited.
Some interactions are very slow and hard while operating the thermostat.
Very few users are using the voice controlled thermostat.   

We noted down the user constraints on existing products : 

Voice commands are limited to the use for the product.
The UI of the app is less effective while using the app.
 New users don’t know how to use the app using the voice commands.


After knowing about the business constraints and user constraints, We analyzed it and noted down the user and business goals.</p>

<p class="text"><b>Business Goals :</b> Create an app that has rich voice commands, increase the number of new users to use voice controlled app, functionality of the app needs to be more effective and intuitive while using.</p> 

<p class="text"><b>User Goals : </b>Create a better UI for the App, More people can control the app using the voice commands, Increase the functionally of the app.

    <p class="text">Solving our design problem started with a user research process. We have started to prepare questionnaires and conducted one on one interview with target group users.

        Interactions with different users gave numerous insights on the problems they face while using the app, how they are frustrated with the limited functions on the app, How they feel when they don’t know how to interact with voice commands while using the app.</p>
       <p class="text">Interviews were conducted for each user with a notion to identify the user pain points and create a solution for the ease, difficulties faced while using the existing product.</p>
       <p class="text">I also engaged as a moderator during the interview process recording the behaviours and approach of the audience who were participating in the user interview.</p>

She has a thermostat that she can operate manually or she can operate it using the mobile app. She is very new to voice interaction of the device. She don’t know how to operate the device with voice controls. She would like to know and try a new device which is working on voice controlled devices. She is a very enthusiastic woman to learn new things about technology. While she is working in the kitchen or cooking, she used to go to the thermostat and change it manually every time or She has to change it using the mobile app. Since she would like to know more about the details that she can learn and operate a voice controlled device. She finally found the voice controlled home thermostat that she can happily operate using voice commands.</p>

He always spends his holidays with his family in different places outside his home. He always worried about his home. In his home he doesn’t have a smart thermostat that saves his energy, money and his time. He always spends weekends outside the home, that time the thermostat either hot or cold. He is so disappointed with his old thermostat. Then he started to explore a thermostat that he can control using the voice commands as well as remotely. Then he found the home thermostat with a voice controlled device with more adopted holiday options. Jackson is happy to use a voice controlled device that allows him to create a holiday mode scheduling with time, date, day, automated heat on and off button that can save Jacksons time and money.</p>

She would like to have a thermostat that saves her energy, time and money. She is always looking for the thermostat so she can set up different modes remotely with voice controlled devices so that she can easily operate the device in her busy time. Also she is looking for the kids mode for kids that the kids can not change the thermostat. Since, she has started to explore the thermostat that she found a voice controlled thermostat. Finally she found the home thermostat that comes with a voice controlled device. Giving up on voice commands to the device allows her to schedule various options like time, humidity, active room, temperature, fan and she can save this scheduling with her favorite name like “home”. Also she can add more scheduling modes or she can choose any existing mode in the thermostat using the voice commands. Once done with her scheduling she can lock the device that kids can not make any changes to the device.</p>

           <p class="text"> <b>Storyboard :</b>       We have designed a storyboard to represent the visual aspect of scene by scene on our key scenarios. The storyboard helps us to reveal whether our concept is working or not and clearly conveys how the story will flow as the scenes are worked together. Also it allows us to see potential problems that would not go unnoticed, ultimately save our time. Storyboard helps us to focus on the user rather than the solution.</p>

    <p class="text"> 
        Gathering ideas from the storyboard, I drafted the user flow(Dialog flow) that the user would attempt to achieve their goals. For the voice user interface applications the app needs to work on two different interactions together. Since we created a dialog flow which helps us to design and integrate a conversational user interface into mobile apps. We created three various dialog flows for three different kinds of target users.

        <li><b>Users did not find any navigational functions on particular rooms like bed room, kitchen. Since users face trouble to give different functionalities to the particular room. For example : If the user has to change bed room from active mode to non active mode or delete, edit. Since to perform these all functions on a desired room since the user did not find any navigational functions on the desired room. Since implementing all these elements on our existing prototype I have redesigned a prototype scene with the included additional functions on the desired room.</b></li>
        <li><b>Users unable to set active and inactive mode for the desired room while scheduling new mode as well as holiday mode. Since the user has an option on choosing the active as well as inactive room while scheduling the desired mode. So I have solved these problems to redesign our flow of the app as well prototype screen which helpful for to edit active and inactive mode for the scheduling modes. Below you can view the edited version of the prototype.</b></li>
        <li><b>Users unable to set temperature and the fan mode for the active and inactive rooms, because there is no clear navigation on the flow of the app since the user failed to perform a task. So to solve these problems we redesign a flow of the prototype.  So when redesigning the flow of the app, User first chooses the active and the non active rooms and then the user can easily set the fan and the temperature for rooms.
