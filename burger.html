    <h2>RESPONSIVE WEBSITE DESIGN FOR THE RESTAURANT: SPECIAL BURGER</h2>   
     <p class="one">Every restaurant has a unique style and food products. In the digital world everyone would like to save their time and order choice of food. So, nowadays everyone would like to prefer to use an online food ordering system to save their time and get food.The food business is faster and gets more benefit for the owners through the online ordering process. 

The special burger website is designed for an entrepreneur, who wants to open a new, delivery-only establishment that delivers food (or drink) to customers living nearby. The centerpiece of the website will be an online food customization and ordering system.

Since, I have decided to create the responsive website design for the restaurant. Special burger restaurant website is a responsive website design that customers can order using mobile as well as desktop. Special burger responsive website design is a capstone project of UI/UX design specialization through University of CalArts &amp; Coursera.

    <img class="one" src="image/concept1.jpg" alt="user research" width="35%" > 
    
   <p class="two">The process begins with coming up with the project ideas. In this process, I have research on different kinds of restaurants, unique styles, food customizations that interact with the customers about their restaurants. During the research process, I have noticed that so many restaurants provide food related to their location uniqueness of the peopleâ€™s requirements. Also the catering of food is divided into different categories like business events, residential events, birthday parties, wedding events, etc. After researching the existing restaurant website, I have documented the restaurant's name, description of food customizations served by the restaurant, the main target audience, location of the restaurant and estimation of the cost of the food.
</p> 
    
      
  <h4>What I have found from user research? </h4>       
 
<ul class="two">
     
<li class="two">Users can find food customization for the catering purpose.</li>     
<li class="two">The restaurants provide only adult food requirements for the customers. </li>     
<li class="two">Catering process not provide online for the fast food related customizations

</li>
<li class="two">Users getting the trouble to get the notifications about the ordered food and delivery time.
</li>
<li class="two">The customers take more time to pay for the order process.
</li>
    <li class="two">The user takes more time to find restaurant contact details.

        <h3>USER PERSONAS:
</h3>
    
   <p class="two">I have created the user personas based on the user requirements.I have noted down the number of requirements of the client as well as the customer. In this process, I have created the user personas about the three different category people like event organizer, resident head, resident owner. From the user personas, I have noted down the user [client,customer] needs and goals.

        <h3>SITEMAP:
</h3>
<p class="two">To create the sitemap, first I have to separate the list of the content requirements and functional requirements. Content requirement helps me to know what content should be included in the website, organize the content in the website, to create the different graphics styles for the website that make the website beautiful and creative.

Second, I have listed out the functional requirement for the website. Functional requirement of the website helps to create an easy navigation for the website. Finally I have created the sitemap for the restaurant website which clearly demonstrates the website navigation and content of the home page, about page, contact page, FAQ page, food order process screens, profile page etc.
