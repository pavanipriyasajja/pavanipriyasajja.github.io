They have conducted the use research on the project and they come up with the design stage of the project. Our team has started group discussion on the key insights from the user research process and we started implementing on the online website screens.

       <p class="text">Each of the team members have different tasks related to the project to complete it within the provided deadlines. My major area of the project is designing a login as well as signup screens so the user can signup or login to the online courses. Also I have designed the my learning screens on the project that helps users to know the course summary and they can access all the course content from the my learning screen as well as they can view their course progress.
Also I have created a user profile screen so the user can easily save their general information regarding the course.

 </p>    
    
        <p class="text">Most of the websites that I have worked on designing the website with maintaining the brand consistency in mind. At the very beginning of the project started with knowing about the existing online course that super purposes provides for the users. What are the major purposes of the courses and how the user is interacting with the courses and how did they get a good learning experience from Super Purposes courses. While knowing all about the courses, I understood the courses are very valuable and there is a lot of information that provides super purposes to their learners. 
</p>   
        
        <p class="text">Once I understood about the course as well as participating with the market research team meeting, I totally understood that initially we have to do a design features research as well as the perform competitive analysis on the courses with other competitors in the market to analyze weakness as well as strengths of the website design features, as well as these design research and competitive analysis on the design features are most important to come up with the new design features that helps to create a user friendly website.

   <p id="subheading">What design research we have did on the websites:

Since we have a couple of thoughts on the login. </p>

   <p id="subheading">Learnings from Super Purposes Internship:</p>  
-->
    <p class="text">Super purposes is my first internship and I am having a wonderful experience working on projects.  As a UX Designer, I am not only focusing on the tasks that are provided during the internship. Also I do have a freedom of opportunity to explore more side projects and we can learn every aspect of the company and we can have a chance to participate on each and every company related tasks.  As part of exploring the size projects I was a part of marketing and future comparison team members where I learned  exciting things that are done on competitor analysis to identify weaknesses and strengths of the company. Also we can do a design feature competitor analysis so we can create outstanding results on high fidelity mockups as well as user flows.</p>
