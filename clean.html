    <h2>CLEAN FOLD: mobile App design[ UX design process]</h2>   
     <p class="one">In the city of Hyderabad [India] there are so many people using the manual method for laundry service for everyday life. Laundry service providers provide different kinds of services like cleaning, washing clothes, ironing and folding clothes, pick up the clothes and provide the service and deliver to their owners, also use payment for the service also manual. 

Since, I have got an idea about the laundry app design for the laundry service app that makes it easy to use for the customers and laundry service providers. I have designed the Clean Fold mobile App design, the app provides different services for customers and clients like pickup the clothes, provide the laundry service and deliver to their owners, make payment through online. Also the user can view the tracking of the delivery clothes.

Clean fold laundry service mobile app design is a project of the UI/UX design specialization course through the CalArts &amp; Coursera.

  <h2>PROCESS: </h2> 

     <h3>USER RESEARCH:</h3>
    
    <img class="one" src="image/stackholder.jpg" alt="user research" width="35%" > 
    
   <p class="two">In the user research process, I have started to start research and observe existing apps and note down the user requirements and user goals. After that, I have prepared questionnaires and interviewed laundry service providers and customers. With their permission, I have recorded the user pain points and goals. 
</p> 
    
      
  <h4>What I have found from user research? </h4>       
 
<ul class="two">
     
<li class="two">Still there are so many users using the manual method to count the clothes and note down in the book.</li>     
<li class="two"> The laundry service providers still use the record book to write down the client name, details, location and number of clothes and service for the clothes.</li>     
<li class="two">The customer paying the cost of the service manually.


</li>
<li class="two">The customer is getting trouble finding the contact details of the laundry service provider.
</li>
<li class="two">The customer is getting trouble knowing about the cost of the service.

        <h3>USER PERSONAS:
</h3>
    
   <p class="two">User personas help me to understand the user pain points and user goals. I have created the customer as well as laundry service provider personas. From this personas I have noted down the customer requirement and laundry service provider requirement.

        <h3>MAPPING CONTENT &amp; INTERACTION, USER TESTING, CREATING SITEMAP:

</h3>
<p class="two">Mapping the content and the interaction is useful for organizing the content and creating a functional design for the mobile app. Using the mapping the content and interaction helps me to create a sitemap for the mobile app. Creating the sitemap is a way that I have created the easy navigation for the mobile app which helps me to create a paper prototype of the mobile app design.

     <h3>PAPER PROTOTYPE &amp; USER TESTING:</h3>
    
    <img class="one" src="image/ut.jpg" alt="user research" width="35%" > 
    
   <p class="two">From the sitemap, I have created the paper prototype for the mobile app design. Then I have conducted multiple walkthroughs for the paper prototype that helps me to better understand the flow of the prototype and easy to interact with the first time user.

Then, I have conducted Nielsen's ten usability heuristics, that helps me to major and minor usability problems for users while using the app. Finally, I have conducted the user test with real users and then listed down the user problems while using the prototype.

  <h4>What did I find from the user testing?
 </h4>       
 
<ul class="two">
     
<li class="two">Customers can not view all the main details of the laundry service providers.
</li>     
<li class="two"> The details of the customer required more than easy to understand the laundry service providers like pick up and delivery location, timing for the service available, etc.</li>     
<li class="two">The laundry service provider needs to provide the cost of the service.



</li>
<li class="two">User needs to know the screen that your order has been received. That helps users to know about the conformation of the service.
