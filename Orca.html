       <p class="text">We are 7 members of UX Design team working on second iteration process of mobile version of orca sound live listening application. As a part of UX design team I have understood key insights on usability studies report on first interaction of the live listening application to come up with new design ideas to improve the onboard experience of the application. Produce those ideas with 10 members of peoples, includes the stakeholders, UX team leads and remaining our UX design team members to implement those ideas on the application.

Participated in usability studies on second iterated application [2/10] to identify user problems while user interacts with the application.

      <p class="text">This is one of the screens of the application. Using this screen, the user can see the port-townsend location on the map. Also users can navigate to port-townsend on the screen to know about the port-townsend. As well as using this screen, users can play orca’s sound and report that sound to the marine center. </p>

      
      
      <p class="text">We redesigned the port-townsend screen. In the previous screen the play and the port-townsend is confusing the users because they seem to have two different options for the users to navigate and report a sound. We created a card view since the user can easily recognize how to hear an orca sound and report the orca sound to the marine center.

As well as we introduce the pop up option for the users to subscribe to newsletter and latest updates on the Orca sound. When users scroll on the remaining screen the pop up will go away and the users can view the applications home screen.

      <p class="text"><b>Collaboration is a key in any design projects or any other projects. I have learned good collaboration skills with other group of team members. How to collaborate on our design ideas and give valuable feedback on the project. Also raise the new design points to improve the existing design.

      <p class="text"><b>When we are working  on a school project we have a little learning experience on working with the project. But when we are working on real world projects. There are other multidisciplinary team members who are participating with the project to improve. Understanding the team's requirements and approaching their needs and requirements on the project is a big challenge to work on a project.

      <p class="text"><b>Working with the awesome creative design team is a very challenging thing to understand other team members' ideas and also work with them.
