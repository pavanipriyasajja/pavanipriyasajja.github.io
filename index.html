       <h4>Work-Tracker mobile App design</h4> 
          
     
      <p class="one">The work tracker mobile app is used for work schedule, track a time working with laptop [per day, week, month], also track the eye strain level of our eyes. Work tracker app case study [capstone project] is the last course of the Interaction design specialization through University of California San Diego &amp; Coursera.

       <h4>Responsive website design for restaurant</h4> 
          
     
      <p class="one">The special burger [Restaurant] website is designed for an entrepreneur, who wants to open a new, delivery-only establishment that delivers food (or drinks) to customers living nearby. The centerpiece of the website will be an online food customization and ordering system. Since, I have decided to create the responsive website design for the restaurant. Special burger restaurant website is a responsive website design that customers can order using mobile as well as desktop.

       <h4>Little Heart - UI design case study</h4> 
          
     
      <p class="one">Parents would like to know about their expecting baby heartbeat. Since I have designed a digital heartbeat monitor for baby expecting parents that turns on the mobile device which shows the heartbeat of the baby and records the baby's heartbeat. The recorded heartbeat of the baby is stored into the gallery. The recorded baby heartbeat can share through the app. The heartbeat monitor can work for different months for pregnant women to show their babyâ€™s heartbeat on the mobile screen.

       <h4>CLEAN FOLD: Mobile App design</h4> 
          
     
      <p class="one">Laundry service providers provide different kinds of services like cleaning, washing clothes, ironing and folding clothes, pick up the clothes and provide the service and deliver to their owners, also use payment for the service also manual. Since, I have designed the Clean Fold mobile App design, the app provides different services for customers and clients like pickup the clothes, provide the laundry service and deliver to their owners, make payment through online. Also the user can view the tracking of the delivery clothes.

    <p class="full"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>

    <p class="full">I am Pavanipriya Sajja.</p>

    <p class="full">I am interested in observing various users and users' needs to find the user problems and solve them using the design thinking methodology - emphasis, define, ideate, prototype and test to solve the problems and create innovative design solutions.</p>

    <p class="full">Also using the formal elements of user interface - look and feel, design patterns, typography, hierarchy and composition of the elements to create beautiful user interface design for various digital devices.</p>

    <p class="full">I have graduated in electronics and communication engineering. But I did not get interested in these subjects since I have decided to change my career.</p>

<p class="full">I have started to learn Adobe tools and then started to create mockups for various digital devices. Also started to design digital mockups and complete those mockups in <a class="full" href="https://99designs.com/" target =#blank>99design.com</a> platform.

    While working on these mockups, I have found UX and UI to create innovative solutions for various digital devices. Then I started to learn UX courses on Coursera.org and worked on different projects.</p>

    <p class="full">While working on these projects, I have applied all the skill sets that I learned from interaction design courses and UX/UI courses and found the user problem and created innovative design solutions for users.</p>

    <p class="full">Currently, I am looking for opportunities to work on real world problems to continue my journey towards UI/UX design.My goal is to solve the user problems and create beautiful user interfaces and grow my career towards my design journey and my skill set is useful for the company as well as user benefit.</p>
