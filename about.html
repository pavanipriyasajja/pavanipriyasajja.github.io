        <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
            
         I am Pavanipriya, you can call me <u>Priya.</u>


<p>I am a recent graduate UX designer from Bellevue College dedicated to creating a better experience for the Users. I love and enjoy, when it comes to topics about design and Technology. I am always interested in observing various users and userâ€™s needs to find user problems and solve them using the UX design methodologies to create innovative design solutions. 
</p>
    
<p>Currently I am working at Super Purposes as a UX design intern. At Super Purposes I have worked closely with multi-disciplinary teams to gather and understand requirements of the website and we designed Super Purposes online learning platform that provides a variety of career courses to help millions of job seekers to find a dream job. Also I am volunteering as a UX designer for the Orca sounds (Open source web-app(at live.orcasound.net) that lets users listen for whales and act to conserve them.) Where I am gathering usability studies feedback on an orca listening app, collaborating with a group of team members to update or redesign existing mobile responsive screens for the orca sound website. Take part in weekly team meetings to discuss project goals and represent our ideas and work with a multidisciplinary field. 

Although, I gained a good hands on experience with working on multiple design projects as per the user requirements during my College course. My most interesting projects are voice UI for the thermostat, vegan share, garden planting application. While working on these projects, I have learned the different user experience methods and skills to create a delightful design experience from scratch to fully developed prototypes. I did a couple of UX design courses through coursera platform. During these specializations I have worked with the projects called little heart, Special burger, work tracker and Clean fold, while working on these projects I gained a good experience on applying UX &amp; visual interface design skills to create or improve overall design experience.

 </p>              
    
<p>I am actively looking for the Design opportunity to land my dream job. My Goal is to work on multiple projects and my skill set is useful for the company as well as user benefit. In my free time : Love to create pencil drawings, cooking and watching movies.

 </p>
