Discuss with my team, we find out user needs for the website and analyze the user needs and document the user goals for the website. Our website mainly focuses on vegan recipes for community people and how the community minded liked people share their cooking recipes and share their experience as a vegan diet follower.

</p> 
      <img id="desired" src="image/competitive.png" alt="desired-goals" > 
     <p class="text"> 
         We took five websites as a competitor website. In these five websites there are some different features related to vegan recipes. Some websites focus on veganism and some websites focus on recipes and some of them focus on community based activities. After conducting the competitive analysis we have figured out the features of our website and take notes on what objects we need to add in our website or any changes made to our website.</p>

            <p class="text">
                Our team has started to work on user research of veganshare websites. First we have worked on demographics and psychographics of the user needs. Then we have started to prepare a questionnaire for a user interview and then our team has started to conduct a user interview of two people. And we took notes on it. Also I have researched on beginner level to expert level of vegan diet follower people and really what they want to do in their real life to improve their physical fitness and staying healthy for them and their family. How veganism changed their everyday life.</p>
            
           <p class="text">  You have to take a little survey about the vegan diet followers that you can know more about the vegan people and how they are following recipes in their everyday life ?
 
               Before conducting the surveys we have to find out what do you use like a list of demographics and physiography.</p>

            <li><b>We found that people usually follow the vegan diet based on their religion, fitness levels, health issues or would like to stay healthy for a long time.
</b></li>
            <li><b>Every family has different concerns about their diet like they want to keep their family healthy for aged people or kids or adults.
</b></li>
            <li><b>People have less knowledge about the vegan diet and they would like to be more aware about the vegan diet from watching online videos or articles.</b></li>
            <li><b>Users don't find the best recipes on websites, so they don't have much knowledge about vegan recipes.</b></li>
             <li><b>Users might be interested in sharing theri cooking videos through an online website but they don't have many particular vegan websites that they can share recipes.</b></li>
                <li><b>Users would like to have a community website where they can share cooking videos, write articles, participate in recipe contests so users can get more knowledge about veganism. </b></li>

             <p class="text"> <b>Scenario (Rebecca)</b>Rebecca is going grocery shopping soon and needs to know what foods and meal ingredients she should be buying in order to fit a vegan diet. She searches for vegan ingredients and finds VeganShare. On VeganShare, she navigates to an FAQ or informational page that gives her basic information on what vegan foods/ingredients are often used in vegan recipes. If she doesn’t find all the information she needs, or has a specific question for a certain ingredient not included in that informational page, she navigates to the forum to see if someone else has had a similar question or submit a question herself. Someone responds to her and gives her the information she needs. Satisfied, she is able to go to the grocery store and shop with confidence, knowing exactly what she needs for her family’s vegan diet.

             <p class="text"> <b>Scenario (Forest)</b>Forest has been into a vegan lifestyle for only about 3 weeks and he is already enjoying the positive impact this change in diet has brough not only to his health, but also his mood. He has found VeganShare so useful that he wants to write a good word for them or leave a good review, he wants other users to join the good habits. Being in the business sector, he knows what this represents for businesses and is willing to do it for free! Therefore, he goes back to the site and looks for an option that leads him to accomplish this task, he then easily finds an option that guides them to leave a good review on the site and there is another one that leads him to connect with the team. He chooses to just leave the good review for other users to read. 

</p>
            
            <p class="text"> <b>Scenario (Naina): </b>Naina is always taking more time to cook for the recipes so she is looking for a website where she can find out less time taking recipes. Also she is very health conscious so she is looking for the nutrition level of the food as well as recipes. She is very interested in cooking so she wants to take part in a community cooking contest and she wants to share her recipes and articles with other community people. She found a vegan share.com website where she can find her all needs. 

She navigates to recipes page then she can view the particular recipes, over click on the particular recipe then she can view the recipe preparation time, ingredients, preparation videos and images. 

She is interested in cooking and she wants to participate in a cooking contest since she navigates to community pages and she can find contest links on the page and then she can participate in contests.

</p>
            <p class="text"> <b>Scenario (Hua Ling)</b>Issue : find more different recipes
Solution: Rorting recipes categories, uses could find the recipe they are looking for more quickly.
Issue : At her age, she doesn’t want to spend more time reading the text. Recipe not only has pictures and text, preferably with video commentary.
Solution : We can mark it on the recipe icon, which contains the video.
