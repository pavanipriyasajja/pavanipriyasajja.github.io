   <p id="heading">Overview</p>  
    <p class="text">We have been excited to know about how much time we spent on professional work, personal work as well as free time activities in our everyday busy life. In the digital world everyone is using a laptop to work for professional as well as personal work, since we don’t know about how much time we are spending time on working with laptop and our eyes are getting strain. Since, I have designed the Work-Tracker mobile App. The work tracker mobile app is used for work schedule, track a time working with laptop [per day, week, month], also track the eye strain level of our eyes.   

Work tracker app case study [capstone project] is the last course of the Interaction design specialization through University of California San Diego &amp; Coursera.  </p>

   <p id="subheading">Project Details:</p>  
    <p class="text"><b>Challenge: </b>To create the interactive User experience for the work tracker app that user can easily schedule their work, track working time per day or week or month, also user can show the eye strain level.</p>
    <p class="text"><b>Timeline: </b> 8 Weeks</p>    
    <p class="text"><b>Role: </b> As a designer, observe the people and understand the user needs and goals as well as create the easy navigation and interactive user Interfaces for the work tracker.</p>    
    <p class="text"><b>Methods: </b> User research, Brainstorm &amp; Ideation, Creating storyboards, paper prototype, Heuristic evaluation, wire-framing, User test [In person &amp; A/B test], Visual design.</p>

For the easy understanding of user needs and goals, I have sketched the storyboard. Two different storyboards locate different way of representing the user goals and needs. From the sketching process, I have noticed and clear understanding about how to create paper prototype.</p>

    <p class="text">The evaluation process started with multiple walkthroughs that helps me to run better my paper prototype and identify problems with it also helps an evaluator can see paper prototype first time and interact with it. 

After that, I have conducted the <b>Nielsen’s ten usability heuristics</b> in-person as well as online evaluation of paper prototype using the slack communication channel. From the heuristic evaluation, I have noted down the most of the user problems while using paper prototype. 
        From all the evaluations:</p>

        <li><b>User getting trouble to schedule their work as well as can not make changes about to do list of the day.</b></li>
        <li><b>The tracking of the work and eye strain level is quite make confusing the users.</b></li>
        <li><b>The home page of the app is confusing the users to find out the work tracking as well as when user wants to return home page there is no back options for the app.</b></li>
        <li><b>The navigation of the app is a little confusing and user can not get the exact screen.</b></li>

       <p id="subheading">Wireframes &amp; Visual Design:</p> 
       <p class="text">First, I have created a development plan for the upcoming task which helps me to complete the project on time. I have created the wireframes for the app’s home screen, tracker for the work and eye strain level screen, profile screen, notification screen for the app. From the wireframes I have created the visual design for the app. I have experimented with typography, color and graphics on the wireframes and then finalize the visual design of the app. I have created the visual design of the app using the sketch app and adobe XD.</p>

From the user test, I have observed the small usability problems while using the app. I have noted down the real world user test. 

After that, I have launched the A/B test. This is the most effective way to find the small usability problems. A/B test is conducted in Usertesting.com, where the final visual app has tested by the three real world users and they give the feedback about the small usability problems. </p>
