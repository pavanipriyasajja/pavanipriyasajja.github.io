            <p class="text"> Designed and developed a clickable high fidelity prototype to establish the concept of Voice User interface mobile application for the Thermostat.</p>

            <p class="text">Created basic thermostat operation flows for the user to operate the thermostat by giving voice commands.</p> 

            <p class="text">Created scheduling mode and holiday mode user flows for the thermostat so the user can schedule their thermostat as per their desired day and time and temperature. </p>

    <p class="text">This is fun, curious as well as an exciting project of Bellevue College Interaction design course. 
      Curiosity to words learning on how  the Voice User Interaction application works perfectly and reduces human effort in everyday life. This curiosity made me want to work on this project.

      While working on this project I have read articles and watched videos related to Voice User Interface Applications. In every article and videos I have seen, everyone is mentioned in their articles and videos on various softwares to design dialog flows as well as using prototyping tools to create High fidelity mockups. Since I have started to explore and spent lots of time on which tools help me to design the entire Voice User Interface application. </p>

     <p class="text"> Totally I got confused and later on I realized that <b>Voice User Interface applications are working on two different interactions (Voice Interactions &amp; User Interactions) together.</b> Then Finally I understood the key insight on how to design and develop voice interface applications.


      <b>Before designing and developing any VUI Applications, we have to understand what is the major purpose of the application why we are designing and developing it then major key insight is using the pen and paper first understand the flow of multiple interactions and identify problems on flow and simplify them and finalize the multiple flows of the VUI Applications.</b> This made my work easy. Once we clear on our flows then whatever tool that we feel is easy we can use to design and develop the VUI Applications.</p>
