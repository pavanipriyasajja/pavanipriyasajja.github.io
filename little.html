    <h2>Little Heart [Project of Visual elements of User interface design]:
</h2>   
     <p class="one">Expecting a baby is a most memorable and happy feeling for the parents. Parents would like to know about their expecting baby heartbeat. Since I have designed a digital heartbeat monitor for baby expecting parents that turns on the mobile device which shows the heartbeat of the baby and records the baby's heartbeat. The recorded heartbeat of the baby is stored into the gallery. The recorded baby heartbeat can share through the app. The heartbeat monitor can work for different months for pregnant women to show their babyâ€™s heartbeat on the mobile screen. 

Little Heart is the UI design case study of the Visual elements of User Interface design first course project of the UI/UX design specialization through CalArts &amp; Coursera.

             <h4>Formal elements of an interface:</h4>
    
    <img class="one" src="image/moodboard.jpg" alt="user research" width="60%" > 
    
   <p class="one">The formal elements of an interface includes icon, image making, look and feel of the app, color and shape; these all elements have each importance in creating the visual elements of the user interface design. I have researched different existing apps and understand the look and feel of the different apps. I have created the Mood board for the little heart, the mood board includes the color for the app, images which makes the app look good, typeface which shows the good interface for the app.

     <h3>SAMPLE PATTERN LIBRARY &amp; HIERARCHY AND COMPOSITION:</h3>
             
             
    
    <img class="one" src="image/pattern.jpg" alt="user research" width="60%" > 
    
   <p class="one">The pattern library helps me to create the different buttons for the app like active, inactive. The pattern library includes creating the different icons for the app that are important. 

Hierarchy and composition of the elements that are useful for the app, which element looks easy to navigate and the location of the element in the screen, Which is easy to use for the user.

  <h3>SKETCH YOUR STATICES:

</h3>

   <p class="one">Final step for the project is to create the mobile screen for the app. I have designed the sketch of the mobile screen like home page and key screen for the mobile app design using the sketch app.

         <h3>LEARNINGS:


</h3>
       
       <br>
         
        <p class="one">I have learnt from the visual elements of the user interface design, that designing the image making for the app makes the user can interact with the app. Creating the iconography that helps the user to better understand and condensed form and users can recognize. Typeface for the app is also an element that changes the look and feel of the app. These are all elements and useful ways to create good user interface design.
