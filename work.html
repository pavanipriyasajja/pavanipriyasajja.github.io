    <h2>WORK TRACKER MOBILE APP DESIGN</h2>   
     <p class="one">We have been excited to know about how much time we spent on professional work, personal work as well as free time activities in our everyday busy life. In the digital world everyone is using a laptop to work for professional as well as personal work, since we don’t know about how much time we are spending time on working with laptop and our eyes are getting strain. 

Since, I have designed the Work-Tracker mobile App. The work tracker mobile app is used for work schedule, track a time working with laptop [per day, week, month], also track the eye strain level of our eyes.   

Work tracker app case study [capstone project] is the last course of the Interaction design specialization through University of California San Diego &amp; Coursera. 
</p> 
       
<h2>PROJECT DETAILS: </h2> 
<ul class="one">
    
<li class="one"><p class="one"><b>CHALLENGE:</b> 

To create the interactive User experience for the work tracker app that user can easily schedule their work, track working time per day or week or month, also user can show the eye strain level.</p></li>    
       
<li class="one"><p class="one"><b>TIMELINE:</b> 8 Weeks</p></li>

<li class="one"><p class="one"> <b>ROLE:</b> 

As a designer, observe the people and understand the user needs and goals as well as create the easy navigation and interactive user Interfaces for the work tracker. </p> </li>



<li class="one"><p class="one"><b>METHODS:</b>

User research, Brainstorm &amp; Ideation, Creating storyboards, paper prototype, Heuristic evaluation, wire-framing, User test [In person &amp; A/B test], Visual design.</p></li>

  <h2>PROCESS: </h2> 

     <h3>USER RESEARCH:</h3>
    
   <p class="two">The process begins with need findings. For the need findings, I have started three different people like designer, working women, software Employee. During the observation process, I have noticed some user problems as well as I have prepared the questeniors for the interview process. I have interviewed three people and note down user goals and pain points.

<ul class="two">
     
<li class="two">User getting hard to take notes on how much time spending time with laptop per day or week or month, Still user using the different website or manual record to maintain working time.</li>     
<li class="two">User wants to know about how much eye strain level, as well as its hard to take notes about it. </li>     
<li class="two">User needs to get notification about work tracking and eye strain level.

 <h5>BRAINSTORM AND IDEATION:</h5>
<p class="two">From the brainstorming and ideation process working on user research outcomes, we noted down major user goals, user needs and user problems. </p>    
        

 <div class="row">
     
     
<div class="column">
<h4>User pain points: </h4>
<ul class="two">
 <li class="two">It’s hard to take notes and maintain for a long time as well as to track work time per day.
User taking notes using the excel sheet, but it can not track time of work as well as eye strain level at the same time for this user needs to calculate separately and spent more time on it.
     </li>   
    
    <li class="two">User can not easily schedule their work and manage it. User still using the manual record or using different variety of software which is hard for them to schedule work for the day or week or month.
</li>  
    
    <li class="two">User can not get easily notification or reminder about their work if they are using different software or manual recording their work data.</li>

<h4>User Goals: </h4>
<ul class="two">
    <li class="two">User needs to schedule work easily and can view to do list of the day that the user can edit or delete the scheduled work.
</li>   
    
    <li class="two">User can view clearly their work track record for the day or week or month, also the user can view details of their work.
</li>  
    
    <li class="two">User can view eye strain level of the day or week or month.
</li>  
    
    <li class="two">User can get the notification and reminder about the details of scheduled work as well as track record of the work as well as eye strain level.

     <h5>SKETCHING &amp; PAPER PROTOTYPE:
</h5>
        
        <h3>SKETCHING:</h3>
    
   <p class="two">I have designed the storyboard from the ideation and brainstorming process. 
For the easy understanding of user needs and goals, I have sketched the storyboard. Two different storyboards locate different way of representing the user goals and needs. From the sketching process, I have noticed and clear understanding about how to create paper prototype.

        <h3>PAPER PROTOTYPE:</h3> 
        
 <p class="two">I have created the low - fidelity paper prototype that can help me to create most effective visuals of the mobile app design as well as to create the easy navigation for the app. The paper prototype helps me to focus on the conceptuals work of figuring out my app information architecture and functionality of my app, and save me from wasting hours twiddling pixels.

   <h3>HEURISTIC EVALUATION </h3>
    
   <p class="two">The evaluation process started with multiple walkthroughs that helps me to run better my paper prototype and identify problems with it also helps an evaluator can see paper prototype first time and interact with it. 

After that, I have conducted the <b>Nielsen’s ten usability heuristics</b> in-person as well as online evaluation of paper prototype using the slack communication channel. From the heuristic evaluation, I have noted down the most of the user problems while using paper prototype. 
From all the evaluations:

</li>     
    <li class="two">The tracking of the work and eye strain level is quite make confusing the users.
 </li>     
    <li class="two">The home page of the app is confusing the users to find out the work tracking as well as when user wants to return home page there is no back options for the app.

</li>
    <li class="two">The navigation of the app is a little confusing and user can not get the exact screen

     <h5>WIRE FRAMES &amp; VISUAL DESIGN :</h5>
    
   <p class="two">First, I have created a development plan for the upcoming task which helps me to complete the project on time. I have created the wireframes for the app’s home screen, tracker for the work and eye strain level screen, profile screen, notification screen for the app. From the wireframes I have created the visual design for the app. I have experimented with typography, color and graphics on the wireframes and then finalize the visual design of the app. I have created the visual design of the app using the sketch app and adobe XD.

       <h3>Testing with real world user and A/B Test:</h3>
       
       <img class="two" src="image/usertest.jpg" alt="user research" width="30%" > 
    
   <p class="two">This is the final step of the interaction design project. For the in person user test, I have developed a protocol and then with the user permission I have record the observations.
From the user test, I have observed the small usability problems while using the app. I have noted down the real world user test. 

After that, I have launched the A/B test. This is the most effective way to find the small usability problems. A/B test is conducted in Usertesting.com, where the final visual app has tested by the three real world users and they give the feedback about the small usability problems. 


</p> 
     
<h3>What feedback receive my final version of prototype:</h3>         
     
     
<ul class="two">
     
<li class="two">Once schedule the work then the user needs to get notification about the work has scheduled.
</li>     
<li class="two">Every notification needs to more options that the user can delete or mark as read or new notification will show in different like different in color. 
 </li>     
<li class="two">The to-do list needs to multiple options that the user can share, delete or edit the list.

</li>
<li class="two">The tracking screen shows the tracking data in details and needs more option that shows all the data in details.
</li>

<ul class="two">
 
     
<li class="two">I have learnt from this interaction design specialization project that using the design thinking process that helps designers to understand the real world user problems and solve it by creating the beautiful user interactions.

</li>     
<li class="two">Create beautiful user interface of the app that includes visual screens of the app, graphics, iconography, typography, using the color pallete that helps for making beautiful color combinations of the app.
 </li>     
<li class="two">Work tracker app is the final presentation of the app before coming to this final stage, I have applied the user research, Brainstorming and ideation, Create a storyboard and paper prototype, Heuristic evaluation, User test and to create a clickable prototype.
