            <p class="profile-text2">Super purposes is my first internship and I am having a wonderful experience working on projects. As a UX Designer, I am not only focusing on the tasks that are provided during the internship. Also I do have a freedom of opportunity to explore more side projects and we can learn every aspect of the company and we can have a chance to participate on each and every company related tasks. As part of exploring the size projects I was a part of marketing and future comparison team members where I learned exciting things that are done on competitor analysis to identify weaknesses and strengths of the company. Also we can do a design feature competitor analysis so we can create outstanding results on high fidelity mockups as well as user flows.</p>
